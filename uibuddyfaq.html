   <h1> FAQ: </h1>
   <p> Q: Why can't I set my own background/icon, Python keeps saying it's not defined?
   <hr>
A: Python (at least the interpreter) hates spaces, dashes and some other stuff because of Unicode (of course),
so as of right now, I would say put your background/icon in a directory with none of these symbols in the name,
and rename the file itself too. Sorry! I'll try to do something about it in 0.3 but no promises! :(
<hr>
Q: The custom background I chose doesn't fit the whole window. What do?
<hr>
A: If you want the image to cover the window, make the window size the same as the image size.
Like, for example, a 640x480 image needs a 640x480 window.
<hr>
Q: The custom icon I chose doesn't seem to work. What do?
<hr>
A: It is likely due to the icon being small and/or not being in .ico format.
The icons that are provided by me should work, but I can't guarantee custom ones will.
Remember! 24x24, and use cloudconvert to convert it into a .ico! </p>
