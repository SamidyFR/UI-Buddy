   <h1> FAQ: </h1>
   <p> Q: Why isn't the button showing up, or its window?
   <hr>
A: Python hides the window sometimes for some reason, I've tried all that I can, but for now, just look behind your interpreter and you should see it.
<hr>
Q: The custom background I chose doesn't fit the whole window. What do?
<hr>
A: If you want the image to cover the window, make the window size the same as the image size.
Like, for example, a 640x480 image needs a 640x480 window.
<hr>
Q: The custom icon I chose doesn't seem to work. What do?
<hr>
A: It is likely due to the icon being small and/or not being in .ico format.
The icons that are provided by me should work, but I can't guarantee custom ones will.
Remember! 24x24, and use cloudconvert to convert it into a .ico! </p>
